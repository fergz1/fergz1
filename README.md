### Hi there 
### fergz1 here
- I'm a computer science student and am currently working on my first software development project.
- Courses I'm taking this term include ones covering software engineering, operating systems and artificial intelligence.
- I'm new to GitHub and look forward to exploring it and using it for both university and personal projects.
